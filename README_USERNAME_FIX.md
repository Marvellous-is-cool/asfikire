# Anglican Student Fellowship Username Fix

## Overview

This project fixes an issue where entering the username "marvellous" during voting would display as "goodness" in the vote details. We also addressed Firebase Firestore permission errors due to expired security rules.

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Fixes

- `lib/auth.js`: Modified `autoAuthenticateMember` function to preserve input username
- `components/VotingAuthForm.jsx`: Fixed username persistence in localStorage
- `firestore.rules`: Updated security rules without expiration date
- `firestore.indexes.json`: Added required database indexes
- `deploy-firebase-rules.sh`: Created deployment script

### Debugging Tools

- `components/DatabaseDebugger.jsx`: Database search and authentication testing
- `components/UserFixUtility.jsx`: Tool to find and fix duplicate usernames
- `app/debug/page.jsx`: Updated debug page with both tools
- `debug-auth.js`: Enhanced authentication debugging tools
- `username-test.js`: Script for testing username persistence

### Documentation

- `USERNAME_FIX.md`: Technical documentation of the fix
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`: Verification checklist
- `FIREBASE_FIX.md`: Firebase security rules documentation

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Firebase Security Rules**

   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy-firebase-rules.sh
   ./deploy-firebase-rules.sh
   ```

2. **Fix Duplicate Usernames**

   - Navigate to `/debug`
   - Use "Username Conflict Resolution" tool
   - Scan and fix duplicate usernames

3. **Verify Authentication**

   - Use Authentication Test tool in Database Debugger
   - Verify usernames are preserved correctly

4. **Test Voting Process**
   - Clear localStorage
   - Vote with username "marvellous"
   - Verify displays correctly

## Technical Solution

The root cause was identified as a username persistence issue in the authentication flow:

1. **Original Issue**: When a user entered "marvellous", the database returned a different username "goodness" (possibly a duplicate or previously linked account).

2. **Fix Approach**: Modified the authentication logic to always preserve the user-entered username throughout the process, rather than using database-returned values.

3. **Key Changes**:

   ```jsx
   // From:
   localStorage.setItem("anglican_auth", JSON.stringify({
     username: userData.username, // DB username
     ...
   }));

   // To:
   const usernameToUse = username.toLowerCase(); // Input username
   localStorage.setItem("anglican_auth", JSON.stringify({
     username: usernameToUse, // Preserved input username
     ...
   }));
   ```

4. **Additional Measures**:
   - Created tools to detect and fix duplicate usernames
   - Updated Firebase security rules
   - Improved authentication debugging capabilities

## Verification

Use the `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` document to verify all aspects of the fix, including:

- Database checks
- Duplicate username resolution
- Authentication tests
- Voting process verification
- Admin view tests
- Edge case tests
