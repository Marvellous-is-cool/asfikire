# Username Display Fix Documentation

## Problem Overview

There was an issue where voting with username "marvellous" would display as "goodness" in the vote details. This problem was caused by a username persistence issue in the authentication flow, where the username entered by the user wasn't being properly preserved throughout the application.

## Root Causes

1. **Username Inconsistency**: The application was using the database-stored username value instead of persisting the user-entered username.
2. **Duplicate Usernames**: Possible duplicate usernames in the database with different capitalization or variations.
3. **Firebase Permission Issues**: Expired security rules caused Firestore permission errors.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Authentication Username Fix

Modified the authentication flow to preserve the user-entered username instead of using the database value:

```jsx
// In VotingAuthForm.jsx
// Changed from:
localStorage.setItem(
  "anglican_auth",
  JSON.stringify({
    username: userData.username, // Was using DB username
    uid: userData.uid,
    family: userData.family,
    isTemporary: true,
  })
);
onComplete(userData.username, userData.family);

// To:
const usernameToUse = username.toLowerCase(); // Use input username
localStorage.setItem(
  "anglican_auth",
  JSON.stringify({
    username: usernameToUse, // Now using input username
    uid: userData.uid,
    family: userData.family,
    isTemporary: true,
  })
);
onComplete(usernameToUse, userData.family);
```

### 2. Duplicate Username Detection & Fix

Created a dedicated User Fix Utility that:

- Scans the database for duplicate usernames
- Automatically renames duplicates to make them unique
- Preserves the oldest account as the original username
- Appends numeric identifiers to duplicates (e.g., username_1, username_2)

### 3. Firebase Security Rules Update

Updated Firebase security rules:

- Removed expiration date to prevent permission errors
- Added proper collection-specific access rules
- Created deployment script for easy updates

## Debugging Tools

### 1. Database Debugger

- Search for specific usernames
- View all users in the database
- Test authentication process

### 2. Username Fix Utility

- Detects duplicate usernames
- Automatically fixes conflicts
- Provides transparent reporting

### 3. Authentication Test

- Tests username authentication
- Shows detailed authentication results
- Helps diagnose specific authentication issues

## How to Use

1. **Fix Username Conflicts**:

   - Navigate to the Debug page (`/debug`)
   - Use the Username Conflict Resolution tool to scan for duplicates
   - Apply fixes if duplicates are found

2. **Test Authentication**:

   - Use the Authentication Test section in the Database Debugger
   - Enter a username to test the authentication process
   - Review the detailed output

3. **Check Database Records**:

   - Use the Search User functionality to find specific usernames
   - Or use the "Load All Users" button to see all user records

4. **Apply Firebase Rules**:
   - Run the `deploy-firebase-rules.sh` script to update security rules
   - This will apply the new rules without an expiration date

## Testing the Fix

Test the fix by:

1. Clearing localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem("anglican_auth")`
2. Vote with username "marvellous"
3. Check that the displayed name is "marvellous" throughout the application
4. Try other usernames to verify consistency

## Additional Notes

- Usernames are now consistently stored in lowercase to prevent case-sensitivity issues
- The Authentication test shows both input and returned usernames for verification
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing user accounts
